# EvapoR

R package to estimate ETo using FAO56 Penman-Monteith equation. (Currently a test version)

# Acknowledgements

The present package was developed during internship on Insitute of Calculus at Universidad de Buenos Aires. The internship was financially aided by CAPES (PDSE, PrInt USP). I also acknowledge CAPES for providing scolarship on the beginning on my PhD (Finance Code 001), and CNPq which became the provider of my PhD scolarship some months before my intership and is the current scolarship provider.

# Notes

This package is a test version, it was mainly developed for fastening the process of estimating ETo evapotranspiration for an application of my PhD research, which is in statistics and does not focus in any related field to the subject of the package. I recommend that any use of the following package should be done with cautious, and that I'm not be responsible for any misuse of the following package.
